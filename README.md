3. Setting Up the Project

a. Clone the Repository
Clone the project repository to your local machine.
Navigate into the project directory.
b. Create a Virtual Environment
Set up a virtual environment to manage dependencies.
Use the command python -m venv venv to create a virtual environment.
Activate the virtual environment using source venv/bin/activate on Linux/Mac or venv\Scripts\activate on Windows.
c. Install Dependencies
